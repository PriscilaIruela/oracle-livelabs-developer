# Oracle Autonomous Database Provisioning

## Introduction

In this lab we provision an **Autonomous Database** using the **Microsoft Azure Portal** that we will use to run the rest of the workshop. 

**Autonomous Database on shared Exadata infrastructure**: Autonomous Database provides an easy-to-use, fully autonomous database that scales elastically, delivers fast query performance, and requires no database administration.

We can provision other 2 flavours of database in Azure:
- O**racle Exadata Database**: You can provision flexible Exadata systems that allow you to add database compute servers and storage servers to your system at any time after provisioning.

- **Base Database**: Using ODSA, you can deploy Oracle Enterprise Edition or Oracle Standard Edition 2 databases on virtual machine DB systems. You can deploy single-node systems or 2-node RAC systems.


**Estimated Lab Time: 15 minutes.**
